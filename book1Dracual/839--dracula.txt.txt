is to ascertain _what_ water.

_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part

to arrange as best he could.

_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we
know of, what he has done here.

As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent

exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
