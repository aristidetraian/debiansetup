knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard

he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the

"Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his
sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no

safety's sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many,
many, happy years for you both."
